Project - Informational Site

You've learned a lot about HTML, CSS & Javascript throughout the past few weeks. Now is your time to creatively put it to use. You will be creating a site that presents an index of something you like! Flowers, cats, restaurants, whatever!

1. You will create an array of 10 objects like the one below. Each object in the array will hold the data for your chosen topic.
2.     var flowers = [
           {
               name: 'Crown Vetch',
               bioName: 'Coronilla varia',
               info: 'Crownvetch provides good forage for deer and elk. Deer have been known to paw through snow to forage on crownvetch in the winter. It provides good cover for ground-nesting birds and is used by rabbits for both food and cover.',
               image: 'vetch.jpg'
           },
           {
               name: 'Simpson Hedgehog Cactus',
               bioName: 'Pediocactus simpsonii',
               info: 'A low-growing succulent native to the southwestern United States. This cactus earned its name because its short, spiny stems resemble hedgehogs. Hedgehog cactus is common in its native range and produces colorful flowers in the spring.',
               image: 'cactus.jpg'
           },
           {
               name: "Parry's Bellflower",
               bioName: 'Campanula parryi',
               info: "This Harebell is relatively uncommon in our area so it is a delight to find. Its flowers are larger than C. rotundifolia's, they range from light to bright purple, and they are either upright or slightly nodding at the end of the stem.",
               image: 'belle.jpg'
           }
       ]

3. Using html, css + javascript, create a Bootstrap Card for each object in your array.   
4. Build your site with custom CSS or a CSS Framework (with a customized touch). You may use any one you want.
5. You must have a nav bar, a header describing your site, a content section for your cards and a footer.
6. HTML, CSS, and Javascript must be valid and well indented.
7. Make sure to make multiple, descriptive commits throughout.
8. Must be hosted on Github, and deployed to surge if possible.
9. Include a README with the deployed link, project description, and wireframe.



Stretch goals:

- Make your site fully responsive.
